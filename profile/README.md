# We are developersðŸ’»

At madebydev, we are a small but passionate team of web developers, programmers, and occasional designers who believe in the power of learning, teaching, and sharing. Our mission is simple: to build web apps that make everyday life easier.

While our core focus lies in web development, our curiosity extends beyond code. We love exploring new technologies and sharing our insights with the broader community, always striving to grow and innovate. At the heart of what we do is a desire to streamline, simplify, and solve problems through tech.

Our main energy is spent building projects that help real people in meaningful ways. We believe that with the right tools, everyone can achieve more.
